<p>We will be making some api calls here. Let's use observables and httpClient module to get some data from api and render it to
    the User Interface.<br>
    Let's start!

<ul>
    <li *ngFor="let employee of employees">Id: {{employee.id}}, Name: {{employee.name}}, Age: {{employee.age}}<br></li><br>
</ul>
